# To-Do List App

In this project, I created a to-do list application that allows you to store to dos and complete them.

## Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this application.

I used for loops, function expressions and declarations and if statements. 

I save all to do list items to local storage and retrieve them on page load to ensure they are persistent on page refresh.

I used `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` to set and retrive the objects to local storage.
